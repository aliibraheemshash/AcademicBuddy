# AcademicBuddy

## About
This project is a web-based platform to help researchers and students access academic papers and books that are unavailable at their own university. By submitting a request via this website, users can connect with volunteers from other institutions who can provide access.

## Features
- Submit requests for papers or books using DOI, title, ISBN, or author name
- Automatic filling of metadata when a DOI is provided
- Animated, interactive background and visually appealing form
- No backend needed – requests are emailed to the admin using Formsubmit.co
- After submitting, users see a friendly thank-you page

## How to Use
1. Go to the website.
2. Fill in your email and the details of the paper or book you need (DOI, title, ISBN, author).
3. If a valid DOI is entered, other fields fill automatically.
4. Click **Submit Request**.  
5. You’ll be redirected to a thank-you page and we will try to respond as soon as possible.
